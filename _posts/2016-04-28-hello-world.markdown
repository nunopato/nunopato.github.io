Sorry, but I have to start somewhere.

This is my personal blog. It will be mostly about programming.

It's my attempt to share my findings with the world and to solidify my own understanding about the topics I write about.

Enough talking, let's get to the code:

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello World!"
#=> Hello World!
{% endhighlight %}
