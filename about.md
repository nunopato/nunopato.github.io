Hi there!

I am a software engineer living in Berlin, Germany.

This is my personal site and blog.

I strongly believe that having a good understanding of the underlying software systems you use everyday is crucial for becoming a better engineer.

This blog is my attempt to keep this motto alive and to share my findings along the way.

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I do writing it.
